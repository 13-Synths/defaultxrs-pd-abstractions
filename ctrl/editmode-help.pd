#X text 284 144 editmode - (try to) detect when edit mode is on.;
#X text 281 208 this abstraction attempts to guess when edit mode is
on. when it's on \, it will output 1.. when it's off \, it will output
0.. i've tried to make this detect all the possible key-combinations
that could turn on edit mode (including the key-combos ctrl+1 \, ctrl+3
\, ctrl+4 \, etc) but i can't detect all of them (such as ctrl+2) \,
so this abstraction cannot be relied upon for accuracy. as far as i
know \, there is no way to tell from pure data whether a window is
in edit mode other than hacky things like this. if you figure something
better out you should let me know!;
